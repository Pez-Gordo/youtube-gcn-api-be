To run this project in your local environment you will need a web server with php and mysql modules. Copy your files into html docs folder. You have to create the database and run the provided sql script "youtube(22).sql" to import the database structure. 

You will need to modify the config.php file. Replace 'root' and 'password' with your own user and password.

Now you are ready to load index.html by navigating to the right folder. When the page loads click in the populate button and wait a few seconds. When the script finishes populating the database you can use the rest of the functionalities.
